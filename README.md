# Todo-App

A simple Todo app built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), to practice and get familiar with React and JS. Basic functionality of adding an item and deleting the item has been added at the moment.

## How to run the App?

- Clone the repo first

  `git clone https://github.com/praaatik/Todo-App`

- Go to the directory of the project

  `cd Todo-App/`

- Start the application

  `npm start`

- The default port has been configured to `3000` but can be updated.

## About the design

The design has been inspired from the [Neumorphic designs](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6). The design for this particular has been referenced from [this codepen](https://codepen.io/jackdomleo7/full/mdeowoz) by Jack Domleo.

Since I'm not primarily a UI/UX designer, I found it best to refer the designs instead of creating them.

## Addendum

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) needs to be installed prior to running the app.

- Things which I might update in the future
  - ~~Adding a dark theme.~~ _Added this_
  - Adding options to update list items.
  - Adding sessions.
  - Adding a backend to store the list items.
  - Making the design responsive.
